subsubheading1: "About me:"

aboutme: "I'm Yaman Kındap, a PhD Student in Engineering and a member of Signal Processing and Communications (SigProC) Laboratory at the University of Cambridge. I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Simon Godsill](http://sigproc.eng.cam.ac.uk/Main/SJG) on a wide range of research areas including stochastic processes, approximate inference and random variate generation. I'm specifically interested in developing accurate representations of highly uncertain systems where rare and extreme events dominate the behaviour. Potential application areas include the study of financial instruments, risk management, climatological sciences and understanding brain functional connectivity."

subsubheading2: "About the blog:"

aboutblog: "As the hype around artificial intelligence and machine learning is still growing, many people are excited by the applications of AI such as machine translation, autonomous vehicles, and medical diagnosis softwares. On top of that, the machine learning research community have provided lots of software libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch which enable people interested in developing machine learning applications to write code with a high-level of abstraction. While these tools are certainly necessary for productivity, many people interested in learning about machine learning processes are mislead into thinking either machine learning processes are trivial because they can write a simple TensorFlow script or machine learning is a completely different field than what people learn in fields such as statistics and optimization. People refer to this situation by using the 'black box' metaphor, where you know what you put into the box and you see what comes out, but you don't have any knowledge about its internal workings.

This blog is intended as a source of lectures on the mathematical foundations of machine learning with the goal of providing readers interested in entering the field of machine learning, a technical source of knowledge. However, I try to keep the lectures as simple as possible to follow and explicitly write about any assumptions or shortcomings of a method in question in order to guide the reader without any gaps of knowledge."
